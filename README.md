## **Vanilla - Enhancement [Light]**

<br>

This Modpack is meant to just add a few QOL features to continue with your gameplay!

In addition there are a few optional mods that are disabled by default as these mostly are just extra features that most players will not want or need.

<br>

*Note: This was made for the purpose of private servers so individuals can interact with each other and the game better.*
